# Deployment

## Release baseline

- Deploy from reviewed commits only.
- Use environment-specific promotion gates.
- Keep rollback steps explicit.

## Safety

- Verify secrets are sourced from approved managers.
- Validate health signals after deployment.

TODO(developer): add command-level deployment steps and rollback commands.
