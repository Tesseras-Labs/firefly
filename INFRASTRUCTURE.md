# Infrastructure

## Baseline

Document infrastructure dependencies and runtime assumptions for this repository.

## Expectations

- Prefer managed services unless self-hosting is justified.
- Keep infra changes traceable to reviewed code.
- Document cost and reliability tradeoffs.

TODO(developer): add concrete infrastructure topology and ownership.
