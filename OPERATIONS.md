# Operations

## Operating posture

This repository should be operable from a clean environment with deterministic commands.

## Baseline controls

- Document deploy and rollback procedures.
- Document on-call or escalation ownership.
- Track incidents and postmortems.

TODO(developer): add service-specific operational runbooks.
